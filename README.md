# Identification of distinct tumor cell populations and key genetic mechanisms through single cell sequencing in hepatoblastoma
This study investigated the cellular and molecular heterogeneity of hepatoblastoma (HB), a pediatric liver cancer, using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Researchers analyzed cells from primary HB tumors, matched background liver tissues, and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. The goal was to identify distinct tumor cell populations and uncover key signaling pathways involved in HB progression. The team found that PDX tumors faithfully recapitulate primary tumor features, identified multiple tumor subpopulations, and discovered a unique proliferative tumor-driving cell cluster (Tr2) characterized by activation of WNT, PI3K, and C-MYC pathways. The findings suggest new directions for personalized therapy development and functional targeting of HB subpopulations.
